# interact
Official Implementation for the intelligibility protocol, PXP.

[![arXiv](https://img.shields.io/badge/arXiv-2410.20600-b31b1b.svg)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20600)

### Installation
We have very minimal dependencies, and you can install them using the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
You might want to create a virtual environment (or use conda) to avoid conflicts with your system packages.
We use **python3.9.18** for all experiments.

You will also have to create a results folder,
```bash
mkdir results
```
Finally, you can place your API keys in a `.env` file in the root directory, a template is in `.env.template`.

### Data
For the RAD task, please write to Prof. Sidong Liu [[email](mailto:sidong.liu@mq.edu.au)].
For the DRUG task, please write to Shreyas V [[email](mailto:shreyas.college@gmail.com)].
Please mention "[INTERACT]" in the subject.
You can then use `src/preprocess.py` to generate the data in the correct format, for the experiments.
This will also summarize the data, using the `summarize` function from `src/utils.py`.

### Reproducing our results (simulation)
To reproduce our RAD results, you can run the following command:
```bash
python src/interact.py --num_iter=5 --machine="claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620" --human_type static
```

To reproduce our DRUG results, you can run the following command:
```bash
python src/interact.py --num_iter=5 --machine="claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620" --task=DRUG --human_type=static --eval_at_start
```
This will output the counts of one-way and two-way intelligible sessions, create a `tags.txt` file of the actual tags exchanged between the two agents and also save the D (`data.pkl`), M (`messages.pkl`) and C (`context.pkl`) (from Procedure 1 in the paper) to the `results/` folder.
To reproduce the trend in Figure 3 from the paper, we ran the above command 5 times and manually extracted the number of strong and ultra-strong intelligible sessions (upto an interaction limit) were generated per agent.

### Reproducing our results (live interaction)
Reproducing the DRUG-Human results requires an expert and so the outcome may be stochastic, but an experiment can be launched using:
```bash
python src/interact.py --num_iter=5 --machine="claude-3-sonnet-20240229" --task=DRUG --no_learn
```

### More information

#### Customizable parameters
Please run `python src/interact.py --help` to see all the parameters that can be customized, we support several LLMs,
and the implementation should ideally run with all LLMs supported by [litellm](https://docs.litellm.ai/).

#### Resuming a failed experiment
If the experiment crashes in between (due to API limits, or wrong input, etc.) you can resume the experiment by passing the `--resume` flag. The `-h` flag describes a group of arguments that need to be passed when this flag is set (path to the ongoing context, messages, metrics, etc. files, these are all saved by the code automatically).

#### Static / Real-time feedback
In general the code allows for interaction between both static and real-time human feedback and an LLM (interfaced by the `XMachine`).
To use the approach with custom data, 
- you can use some form of static human feedback stored in data as a CSV,
- as with the human experiments, one can use the command line and a real expert human for feedback.
- DRUG can also be run in static mode by passing `--human_type=static`

#### How to use the code for a different task
Here, we precisely describe how to use the code for a different task, say MATS (Materials Science).

- Decide the type of feedback you have access to, static (CSV with some predictions and explanations) or real-time (human expert)
- If it is static then you would need to add the data to the `data/` folder.
- Now, depeding on the type of feedback, you should implement a `MATSAgent` class in `src/agents.py` which should inherit from `Agent`.
- Following this, implement `MATSMachine` and `MATSHuman` classes in the same file, to see the differences in real-time / static feedback, you can look at `DRUGHuman` and `DRUGHumanStatic`.
- With this, you need to change the `create_agent` in `src/agent.py` to also be compatible with the new task.
- Finally, you have to implement the `MATS` class in `src/tasks.py` which should inherit from `Task` and borrow code from `RAD` and `DRUG` appropriately.
- Now, you can run the code using the following command: (add this task to the choices for the `--task` argument)
```bash
python src/interact.py --num_iter=5 --machine="claude-3-sonnet-20240229" --task=MATS
```
- We also provide a `--debug` flag, this will clip the train_data to 5 examples, and the val and test data to 2 examples each, this is useful for debugging.

### Example
This is an example interaction (from the RAD task) generated by using the PXP protocol and our implementation
(As explained in the paper, this is a special case of the protocol such that the human-agent can never revise it's internal model).
